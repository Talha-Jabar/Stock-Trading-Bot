# Stock Trading Bot

This repository contains a machine learning project on building a **Stock Trading Bot** that uses predictive models to make trading decisions based on historical stock data.

## Project Overview
The stock trading bot employs machine learning techniques to analyze historical stock prices and predict future price movements. The objective is to simulate automated trading by making buy/sell decisions based on the predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from publicly available stock market data. You can update the dataset path in the Jupyter notebook if using a different dataset.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd stock-trading-bot
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Stock_Trading_Bot.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and simulate trading.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Results
The notebook provides the following outputs:
- Predicted stock price movements.
- Simulated trading performance over a specified period.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate real-time data feed for live trading.
- Explore advanced predictive models such as LSTM and reinforcement learning.
- Add support for multiple stock tickers.
